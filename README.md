# Facial_Weakness_Identification_for_Stroke_Prediction
This project looks to build upon existing work to encode the decision making expertise of neurologists in a computational model. The ambition for this research is to create a computational tool to support paramedics and other emergency medical providers in accurately detecting the presence of stroke thus enabling the early onset of treatment and improving the person's quality of life.

See Mask RCNN > samples > regions > regions.py for my code alterations to train a custom dataset with multiple classes.
